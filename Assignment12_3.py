# Write a program which contains one class named as Arithmetic.
# Arithmetic class contains three instance variables as Valuel, Value2.
# Inside init method initialise all instance variables to 0.
# There are three instance methods inside class as Accept(), Addition(), Subtraction(), Multiplication(), Division().
# Accept method will accept value of Value1 and Value2 from user.
# Addition() method will perform addition of Value1, Value2 and return result.
# Subtraction() method will perform subtraction of Value1, Value2 and return result. Multiplication() method will perform multiplication of Value1, Value2 and return result.
# Division() method will perform division of Value1, Value2 and return result.
# After designing the above class call all instance methods by creating multipleÂ objects.
